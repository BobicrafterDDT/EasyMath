            <h1>How to use modes?</h1>
            <div class="resizing">
                There are many modes to choose from.And in here is explained how<br/>
                to use each mode, but how to get to them? Well... When you run<br/>
                the Engine, a window dialog will pop up. In that window you`ll<br/>
                find three buttons: a <b>start math?</b> button, a <b>Other <br/>
                programs</b> button and a <b>close</b> button.<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to get to the modes?<br/>
                        When you run the Engine, a window dialog will pop up.<br/>
                        In that window you`ll find three buttons: a <b>start math?</b> button,<br/>
                        a <b>start image writer?</b> button and a <b>close</b> button.<br/>
                        The <b>start math?</b> button opens a menu dialog for all of<br/>
                        the math modes. The <b>start image writer</b> button opens you<br/>
                        a window dialog for the <code>ImageWriter</code> program.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>Find biggest General Divisor with two numbers<br/>
                        (FBGD with two numbers)<br/>
                        To get in this mode, you have to go <b>start math?</b> ><br/>
                        <b>FBGD with two numbers</b>. When you click the button<br/>
                        a window will pop up with two text fields, a <b>Ready?</b><br/>
                        button and a <b>go back</b> button. Now all you have to do<br/>
                        is to insert the first number and the second number that is<br/>
                        needed in the calculation. Then you press the <b>Ready?</b><br/>
                        button, it will hide and another button will pop up: <b>Run</b><br/>
                        button. You click that too, and a text will appear next <br/>
                        to the button. That is your result. Now if you want to go back,<br/>
                        you just press the <b>go back</b> button.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>Find biggest General Divisor with three numbers<br/>
                        (FBGD with three numbers)<br/>
                        To get in this mode, you have to go <b>start math?</b> ><br/>
                        <b>FBGD with three numbers</b>. It`s nearly as the same <br/>
                        as FBGD with two numbers, but now there are three text<br/>
                        fields. The rest of it is the same. The difference here<br/>
                        is that you have to insert three numbers and that`s it!<br/>
                        You press the <b>Ready?</b> button and then the <b>Run</b><br/>
                        button. The result is the text besides the <b>Run</b> button.<br/>
                        Then if you want to go back you press the <b>go back</b> button.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>FFSR (Find Face of a Square or a Rectangle)<br/>
                        To get in this mode, you have to go <b>start math?</b> ><br/>
                        <b>FFSR</b>. In here you have to type in the two sides of your<br/>
                        square/rectangle and then you`ll get the face of that.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>FTSR (Find Tour of a Square or a Rectangle)<br/>
                        To get in this mode, you have to go <b>start math?</b> ><br/>
                        <b>FTSR</b>. In this mode you type in the two sides and you get<br/>
                        the tour of your square/rectangle.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>FEON (Find Amount Of Numbers)<br/>
                        To get in this mode, you have to go <b>start math?</b> ><br/>
                        <b>FEON</b>. In this mode you have to insert the start range<br/>
                        and end range of your numbers. Example:<br/>
                            1; 100<br/>
                        One is the start range and a hundred is the end range. It will<br/>
                        give you an output of:<br/>
                            <code>100</code><br/>
                        This is how many numbers there are from on to 100 including<br/>
                        1 and 100.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The next one modes have the same insert mode, but different calculations.<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find Face of a Square or a Rectangle(FFSR)<br/>

                        <b>FFSR</b>. You insert the two sides of the square/rectangle,<br/>
                        then you press the buttons <b>Ready?</b> then <b>Run</b> and<br/>
                        your result is on the side of the <b>Run</b> button. If you <br/>
                        want to go back, you press the <b>go back</b> button.<br/>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>Find Tour of a Square or a Rectangle(FTSR)<br/>

                </ul>
                Here, it is a little complicated since you have to enter a lot of parameters<br/>
                for <b>Fractions</b>. <br/>

                Now, let`s look at the <b>Other programs</b> button. When you click it, a <br/>
                menu will pop up, with all of the other programs there are that are doing<br/>
                other things rather than only math. It depends on what version of the Engine<br/>
                you are, because specifically in this menu, are the main changes. In the first<br/>
                version you have only two buttons (programs): <b>start image writer?</b> button<br/>
                (program) and a <b>start To-Do list maker?</b> button (program).<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image Writer<br/>
                        To get to this mode you have to go to <b>Other programs</b> ><br/>
                        <b>start image writer?</b>. When you enter the menu, you will<br/>
                        find two text fields. In the first one you have to insert the<br/>
                        text file path. In the second one you have to insert the output<br/>
                        file location.<b style="color: red">Note that:</b><br/>
                            > You have to insert both file paths for the very least start<br/>
                              on which disk you are. Example:<br/>
                              <code>
                                txt file path: C:/documents/MyFile.txt<br/>
                                output file path: C:/documents/Out.jpg<br/>
                              </code>
                        <br/>
                    </li>
                    <li>To-Do list maker<br/>
                        To get to this mode you have to go to <b>Other programs</b> ><br/>
                        <b>Start To-Do list maker?</b>. When you enter the menu, you will<br/>
                        see quite a bunch of things. There will be 3 buttons and a text<br/>
                        field(<b>fields</b> for when Replace button is pressed). Here are<br/>
                        the explanations for all of them:<br/>
                        <br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add (item)<br/>
                                With this button you can add an item to your list. To add<br/>
                                an item, you have to type in what do you want to add and<br/>
                                then you click the <code>Add</code> (item) button. Then<br/>
                                your item will be displayed as a text in the lower part<br/>
                                (below the field).<br/>
                                <br/>
                            </li>
                            <li>Remove (item)<br/>
                                With this button you can remove an item from your list. To<br/>
                                remove an item you have to type the item you want to remove<br/>
                                and then you click the <code>Remove</code> (item) button. Then<br/>
                                the item you removed will disappear from the text in the lower<br/>
                                part (below the field).<b style="color: red">Be sure that the item you want to <br/>
                                remove is exactly the same as the item in the list or else the program won`t <br/>
                                work properly!!!</b><br/>
